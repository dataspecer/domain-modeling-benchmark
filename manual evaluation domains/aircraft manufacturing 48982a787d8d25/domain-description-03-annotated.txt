This description is about a specific way to understand and organize information in the field of aircraft manufacturing. Think of it as a map that helps us understand how different things in this field are related and what they mean.

At the heart of this field, we have the concept of a customer and a supplier. <customer>The customer represents the clients who purchase the finished aircraft. They are essential because they are the ones who use the final product.</customer> <supplier>Then we have the supplier, entities that provide parts for aircraft manufacturing. Suppliers play a crucial role in providing the necessary components needed to build an aircraft.</supplier>

A key activity in this field is the <purchases>purchase of aircraft by customers, referred to as purchases. Here, customers obtain the finished aircraft for their use.</purchases> In contrast, <supplies>supplies represents a relationship where a supplier provides a <supply>supply, a range of different parts essential for building aircraft.</supply></supplies>

<party>Both customers and suppliers are part of a larger group called party, representing a generic subject involved in the aircraft manufacturing process. This means that anyone, whether they are buying the finished aircraft or supplying parts, falls under this broad category.</party> <party-code>To identify each party, we use the party code which we also use to refer to the party in the business communication and documentation.</party-code>

<customer-name>Each customer has a unique aspect, their customer name. This is not just a label, but it tells us exactly who the customer is.</customer-name>

Then, we have <aircraft>aircraft, the final manufactured product.</aircraft> <aircraft-serial-number>Every aircraft is unique and can be identified by its serial number.</aircraft-serial-number> <manufacturing-date>The manufacturing date tells us when the aircraft was made.</manufacturing-date> Importantly, <designed-as>every aircraft is designed as a specific aircraft model, indicating the design it follows.</designed-as> <aircraft-model>This model represents different models of aircraft</aircraft-model>, <aircraft-model-code>each with a unique model code</aircraft-model-code> and <aircraft-model-description>a detailed description</aircraft-model-description>.

<consists-of>The aircraft is made up of <part>multiple parts</consists-of>, each an individual component used in its construction</part>. <part-serial-number>Every part has a serial number, making it unique</part-serial-number>, and <part-description>a brief description to understand what it is</part-description>. <designed-as-part-model>These parts are designed as part models, linking each part to its specific design model</designed-as-part-model>. <part-model>A part model represents the design model for individual parts</part-model>, with <part-model-number>a unique model number</part-model-number> and <part-model-description>a brief description to explain what it is</part-model-description>.

Furthermore, there's a crucial concept called <incorporates>incorporates, indicating that an aircraft model incorporates various part models in its design. This shows how different parts come together in the creation of a specific aircraft model.</incorporates>

Lastly, we have the <includes>includes</includes> and <supplied-for>supplied for</supplied-for> relationships.<includes> The includes relationship indicates that <supply>the supply includes specific parts, showing what components are provided for the aircraft's construction</supply>.</includes> <supplied-for>The supplied for relationship shows that each supply is dedicated to the manufacturing of a specific aircraft, linking the parts supplied to the final product they help create.</supplied-for>

Understanding these relationships and entities helps us get a clear picture of how aircraft manufacturing works, from the initial design to the final product reaching the customer.
