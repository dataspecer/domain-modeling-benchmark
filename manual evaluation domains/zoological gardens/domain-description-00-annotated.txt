<zoological-garden>A zoological garden is a complex entity where the interplay of biological diversity, human interaction, and environmental management coalesce into a singular institution aimed at conservation, education, and research.</zoological-garden>

<animal>Animals are the central entities in a zoological garden.</animal> <classified-by>They are classified by <species>species</classified-by>, each possessing unique biological and ecological characteristics.</species> Properties such as <species-name>species name</species-name> and <species-common-name>species common name</species-common-name>, and <iucn-status>IUCN status</iucn-status> characterize the species. <has-specified-diet>For a particular animal, we are also interested in its specified diet which is crucial for managing their welfare and conservation status of the animal.</has-specified-diet> <animal-name>Each animal also has a name which is not unique but our staff uses it to refer to them and we also present animal names to our visitors.</animal-name> <species-name>The species name adheres to international taxonomic standards, ensuring uniformity across scientific and conservation discourse</species-name>, while <species-common-name>the common name is how visitors usually refer to the species</species-common-name>. <iucn-status>IUCN status provides insight into the conservation priority of species, influencing habitat management and breeding programs.</iucn-status>

<diet>The diet of a particular animal in a zoological setting is a fundamental aspect of its care, impacting its health, behavior, and reproduction.</diet> <diet-type>We distinguish different types of diet whether an animal is herbivorous, carnivorous, omnivorous, piscivorous, etc. This classification helps in formulating appropriate feeding strategies.</diet-type> <nutrients>The diet is also related to specific nutrients required to maintain health and vitality. For example, some species may require particular vitamins or minerals in higher quantities than others.</nutrients> <feeding-schedule>For the diet, the feeding schedule is essential. It specifies the frequency and timing of feeding, which can affect the animal's metabolic rate and overall health. Some species may need multiple small feedings throughout the day, while others might suffice with less frequent larger meals.</feeding-schedule> <feeding-technique>The diet can also be associated with a special feeding technique because some animals, especially those with unique physiological or behavioral adaptations, require special methods of feeding that mimic their natural foraging behaviors, enhancing their psychological well-being and physical health.</feeding-technique>

Reproductive details of animal species include reproductive health and management information that is paramount in zoological settings, especially for conservation breeding programs.
First, <reproductive-age>the age at which the species is capable of reproducing, which helps in planning breeding programs</reproductive-age>, is important. This takes us also to the <natural-breeding-time>specific time of year when the animals of that species naturally breed, which can influence how enclosures are managed and when animals are introduced for mating</natural-breeding-time>. <gestation-period>Gestation period, which is the length of pregnancy in viviparous species, is important for monitoring and providing care during this critical period.</gestation-period> <oviparous-species>For oviparous species, <number-of-laid-eggs>the number of eggs typically laid at one time, affects incubation practices</number-of-laid-eggs>.</oviparous-species>

<enclosure><resident-of>Enclosures are specialized habitats designed to mimic the natural environments of the resident species</resident-of>. They are critical for the ethical display and conservation of animals.</enclosure> <provides>A zoological garden provides various enclosures where its animals live and are ethically displayed and conserved.</provides> Each enclosure is characterized by <enclosure-size>its size in square meters</enclosure-size>, <enclosure-type>type (e.g., aviary, aquarium, terrarium)</enclosure-type>, <has-climate-conditions>climate conditions</has-climate-conditions>, and <vegetation>vegetation</vegetation>, tailored to the needs of specific species in the enclosure. The design and maintenance of enclosures are vital for health, providing adequate space, enrichment, and security from potential stressors for each animal housed in the enclosure.

<has-climate-conditions>The climate conditions of enclosures in zoological gardens are complex and need to be tailored specifically to the needs of each species.</has-climate-conditions> <climate-conditions>They are a blend of various controlled environmental factors including temperature, humidity, lighting, and ventilation. These climate conditions are essential for mimicking the natural habitat of animals as closely as possible, which not only ensures their physical health but also supports their psychological well-being by encouraging natural behaviors and physiological functions.</climate-conditions> <temperature>Temperature is perhaps the most critical element in an enclosure's climate conditions. Each species has a specific thermal preference based on its natural habitat, which needs to be mimicked in captivity for optimal health. Many animal species, particularly reptiles, require a range of temperatures within their enclosure to regulate their body temperature by moving between warmer and cooler areas.</temperature> <humidity-level>Humidity levels are vital and important aspect of climate conditions, especially for species from tropical or aquatic environments, as it affects skin health, hydration, and overall comfort.</humidity-level> <light-cycles>Ensuring that light cycles (day and night) in the climate conditions of enclosures are consistent with the natural light patterns of an animal's native habitat helps maintain normal circadian rhythms, which are crucial for feeding, sleeping, and reproductive behaviors.</light-cycles> <ultraviolet-light>Many species, particularly reptiles, require climate conditions ensuring an exposure to ultraviolet light to synthesize vitamin D3, essential for calcium metabolism. The absence of adequate UV lighting in the climate conditions can lead to health problems like metabolic bone disease.</ultraviolet-light> <ventilation>Proper ventilation is essential for maintaining air quality and appropriate climate conditions within an enclosure.</ventilation>

<staff-member><has-member>Staff members of zoological gardens</has-member> are integral to their operation.</staff-member> They include <zoologist>zoologists</zoologist>, <veterinarian>veterinarians</veterinarian>, <caretaker>caretakers</caretaker>, and <administrative-personnel>administrative personnel</administrative-personnel>. Each staff member has a <name>name</name> and <expertise>expertise</expertise>. For the administrative purposes, we need to keep staff member's <birth-date>birth date</birth-date> and <permanent-address>permanent address</permanent-address>. <expertise>Their expertise directly affects animal welfare.</expertise> Caretakers and <assigned-to-as-zoologist>zoologists are assigned to particular enclosures they are responsible for</assigned-to-as-zoologist>. <assigned-as-caretaker>Caretakers can be assigned to more enclosures and they are responsible for daily care and behavioral training of the animals in the enclosure.</assigned-as-caretaker> An enclosure must have more caretakers so that they cover non-stop care which is necessary for most species.</assigned-as-caretaker> <responsible-for>Veterinarians are responsible for medical treatment of particular species. Therefore, they are not assigned to enclosures or individual animals but species.</responsible-for>

<conservation-program><participates-in>Conservation programs a zoological garden participates in</participates-in> are initiatives aimed at preserving biodiversity through in-situ and ex-situ strategies.</conservation-program> <supports>A conservation program focuses on particular species it supports.</supports> <geographic-region><country>Conversation programs with ex-situ strategies also focus on specific countries</country> or geographic regions</geographic-region>. <conservation-program>These conservation programs often collaborate with global conservation entities and are pivotal in research, breeding programs, and reintroduction efforts.</conservation-program> <is-part-of-program>Specific animals may be part of <reintroduction-conservation-program>reintroduction conservation programs.</reintroduction-conservation-program></is-part-of-program>
