The domain modeled by this framework revolves around the academic world of conferences, research papers, submissions, and the individuals involved in these activities. It captures the intricate details of the academic conference process from various perspectives.

Let's start with the concept of a conference. <conference>Viewed as an event where <presented-at>research papers are presented</presented-at> and discussed, a conference is a pivotal element in academic discourse.</conference> It holds <year>a specific year and <location>location, signifying when and where these intellectual gatherings take place</location></year>.

Delving into the realm of academic writing, <research-paper>the research paper emerges as a key component. It's essentially a document presenting original research findings</research-paper>, carrying characteristics such as a <publication-year>publication year</publication-year>, <abstract>an abstract</abstract>, and a <title>title</title>. <presented-at>Each research paper is closely tied to a conference where it is presented, creating a link between the event and the written work</presented-at>.

<submission>The submission acts as a bridge between the research paper and the conference. It represents the act of submitting a research paper for consideration at a conference</submission>. <has-submission>Submissions of research papers</has-submission> have their own unique lifecycle, marked by <submission-date>a submission date</submission-date>, <status>a status indicating where it stands in the review process (like under review, accepted, or rejected)</status>, <submitted-to>and a connection to the conference it's submitted to</submitted-to>. <is-resubmission-of>Importantly, submissions can be resubmissions, indicating an ongoing process of refinement and re-evaluation.</is-resubmission-of>

From an academic's point of view, <author>authors are individuals who have significantly contributed to the creation of a research paper</author>. <written-by>It forms the connection between a research paper and its authors, indicating who wrote the paper.</written-by> Each <affiliation>author has an affiliation, often an academic institution</affiliation>, and <has-corresponding-author>one of them is designated as the corresponding author. This designation is crucial in the academic world as it specifies the primary point of contact for the research paper.</has-corresponding-author>

Parallel to authors are <reviewer>reviewers, a subgroup of the broader category of persons involved in the conference reviewing process. A reviewer, responsible for evaluating the quality and relevance of research paper submissions</reviewer>, <expertise>brings their expertise to the table</expertise>.

<writes>Reviewers write reviews</writes><reviews>for submissions</reviews>. <review>The review is another crucial element, acting as an evaluation or critique of a research paper.</review>

Finally, <person>the person is a general category encompassing all individuals involved in the conference reviewing process</person>. Each person is <name>identified by a name</name> and an <email>email address</email>, ensuring clear and direct communication within the academic community.

In summary, this domain intricately weaves together the roles of authors, reviewers, and other individuals, the processes of writing, submitting, and reviewing research papers, and the events of academic conferences. It highlights the collaborative and iterative nature of academic research, from the conception of a paper to its presentation and critique in a scholarly setting.
