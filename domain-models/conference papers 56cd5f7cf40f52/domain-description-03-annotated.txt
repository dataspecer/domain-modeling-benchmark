The domain we're looking at is all about the world of academic conferences, particularly focusing on research papers, their authors, reviewers, and the submission process. Let's dive in to understand each part.

At the heart of this domain are <conference>conferences, which are events where research papers are presented and discussed</conference>. Every conference <conference-name>has a name</conference-name>, <location>a location where it's held</location>, and <year>a specific year when it takes place</year>. These are the key pieces that define any conference.

<research-paper>Research papers are documents presenting original research findings</research-paper>. A research paper has several defining aspects: <title>a title</title>, <abstract>an abstract, which is a brief summary of the paper</abstract>, and <publication-year>a publication year, marking when it was made public</publication-year>. <presented-at>Each research paper is also linked to a conference where it was presented, thus connecting it to the broader academic community.</presented-at>

<author>Authors are individuals who significantly contribute to creating research papers</author>. An author is a <person>person involved in the reviewing process</person> with <name>a name</name> and <email>an email address</email>. Moreover, <affiliation>the author has an institutional affiliation, which tells us where they work or study</affiliation>. <written-by>A research paper is written by one or more authors.</written-by> <has-corresponding-author>Among the authors, there's a special role known as the corresponding author, who acts as the main contact point for a research paper. This indicates who among the authors handles most of the correspondence related to the paper.</has-corresponding-author>

<submission>Submissions are acts of submitting a research paper for consideration at a conference. <has-submission>A submission of a research paper</has-submission> is a crucial stage in the research paper's life, as it represents the paper in the conference review process.</submission> Submissions have <submission-date>a submission date</submission-date> and a <status>status, which tells us if it's under review, accepted, or rejected</status>. <submitted-to>They are also connected to the conferences to which they are submitted.</submitted-to> <is-resubmission-of>Importantly, if a research paper is resubmitted, the latest submission is the one that's considered for evaluation.</is-resubmission-of>

<reviewer>Reviewers are responsible for evaluating the quality and relevance of submissions.</reviewer> A reviewer is a <person>person</person> that has <name>a name</name> and <email>email</email>. Moreover, the reviewer <expertise>has expertise area, highlighting their specialized knowledge</expertise> <reviewed-by>in which they review submissions</reviewed-by>. <writes>They write <review>reviews</writes>, which are evaluations or critiques of research papers</review>. <reviews>A review is linked to the submission it evaluates</reviews>, again emphasizing the focus on the most current submission of a research paper.

This domain, as you can see, is a structured network connecting people, their works, and the events where these works are showcased. It emphasizes the processes of creation, evaluation, and presentation that are central to academic research. Understanding how each part connects and functions helps us appreciate the meticulous work behind academic conferences and research publications.
