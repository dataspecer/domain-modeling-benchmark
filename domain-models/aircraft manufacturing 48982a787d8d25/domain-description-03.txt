This description is about a specific way to understand and organize information in the field of aircraft manufacturing. Think of it as a map that helps us understand how different things in this field are related and what they mean.

At the heart of this field, we have the concept of a customer and a supplier. The customer represents the clients who purchase the finished aircraft. They are essential because they are the ones who use the final product. Then we have the supplier, entities that provide parts for aircraft manufacturing. Suppliers play a crucial role in providing the necessary components needed to build an aircraft.

A key activity in this field is the purchase of aircraft by customers, referred to as purchases. Here, customers obtain the finished aircraft for their use. In contrast, supplies represents a relationship where a supplier provides a supply, a range of different parts essential for building aircraft.

Both customers and suppliers are part of a larger group called party, representing a generic subject involved in the aircraft manufacturing process. This means that anyone, whether they are buying the finished aircraft or supplying parts, falls under this broad category. To identify each party, we use the party code which we also use to refer to the party in the business communication and documentation.

Each customer has a unique aspect, their customer name. This is not just a label, but it tells us exactly who the customer is.

Then, we have aircraft, the final manufactured product. Every aircraft is unique and can be identified by its serial number. The manufacturing date tells us when the aircraft was made. Importantly, every aircraft is designed as a specific aircraft model, indicating the design it follows. This model represents different models of aircraft, each with a unique model code and a detailed description.

The aircraft is made up of multiple parts, each an individual component used in its construction. Every part has a serial number, making it unique, and a brief description to understand what it is. These parts are designed as part models, linking each part to its specific design model. A part model represents the design model for individual parts, with a unique model number and a brief description to explain what it is.

Furthermore, there's a crucial concept called incorporates, indicating that an aircraft model incorporates various part models in its design. This shows how different parts come together in the creation of a specific aircraft model.

Lastly, we have the includes and supplied for relationships. The includes relationship indicates that the supply includes specific parts, showing what components are provided for the aircraft's construction. The supplied for relationship shows that each supply is dedicated to the manufacturing of a specific aircraft, linking the parts supplied to the final product they help create.

Understanding these relationships and entities helps us get a clear picture of how aircraft manufacturing works, from the initial design to the final product reaching the customer.
