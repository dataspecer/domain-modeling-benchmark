The domain centers around the manufacturing and distribution of aircraft, involving several key elements such as customers, aircraft models, parts, and suppliers.

<customer>Customers represent the clients who purchase the finished aircraft</customer>. They are linked to aircraft through the <purchases>purchases, which signifies the acquisition of aircraft by these clients</purchases>. Additionally, every <customer-name>customer is identified by a name, which is a unique designation of each client in this context</customer-name>.

<aircraft-model>Aircraft models are critical in this domain, representing different configurations of aircraft</aircraft-model>. Each <aircraft-model-description>aircraft model is described in detail</aircraft-model-description> and <aircraft-model-code>assigned a unique model code</aircraft-model-code>. Furthermore, <incorporates>aircraft models incorporate various part models in their design, indicating the integration of different components necessary for constructing a specific aircraft model</incorporates>.

The notion of <party>party is introduced to represent a generic subject involved in the aircraft manufacturing process</party>. Each <party-code>party is uniquely identified by a party code, used for business communication and documentation purposes</party-code>. <customer><supplier>It is an umbrella term encompassing various entities like customers and suppliers.</supplier></customer>

<part-model>Part models denote the design models for individual parts used in aircraft</part-model>. These <part-model-number>models are uniquely identified by a model number</part-model-number> and <part-model-description>accompanied by a brief description</part-model-description>. <part-model>The part model's design and specifications play a significant role in the overall makeup of the aircraft</part-model>.

<supply>Supplies encompass the parts required for aircraft manufacturing, provided by a supplier</supply>. <supplied-for>Each supply is dedicated to the manufacturing of a specific aircraft</supplied-for> and <includes>includes specific parts necessary for this process</includes>.

<part>Parts represent individual components used in constructing an aircraft</part>. <designed-as-part-model>Every part is linked to its specific model, indicating the design it follows</designed-as-part-model>, and <part-serial-number>is identified by a serial number</part-serial-number> and <part-description>a brief description</part-description>. <designed-as-part-model>This linkage to the specific model ensures consistency and standardization in the manufacturing process.</designed-as-part-model>

<supplier>Suppliers are entities that provide parts for aircraft manufacturing. They are a subclass of parties, indicating their involvement in the broader aircraft manufacturing process.</supplier> <supplies>They maintain a relationship where they supply supplies consiting of various parts necessary for the construction of aircrafts.</supplies>

<aircraft>Aircraft signify the final manufactured product in this domain</aircraft>. <aircraft-serial-number>Each aircraft is uniquely identified by a serial number</aircraft-serial-number>, <designed-as>linked to a specific model, indicating the design it follows</designed-as>, <manufacturing-date>and marked with the manufacturing date</manufacturing-date>. <consists-of>The aircraft is also defined by the parts it consists of, highlighting the composite nature of the final product.</consists-of>

This domain, thus, presents a comprehensive view of the entities and their interrelations in the context of aircraft manufacturing, from conceptualization through production to the final purchase.
