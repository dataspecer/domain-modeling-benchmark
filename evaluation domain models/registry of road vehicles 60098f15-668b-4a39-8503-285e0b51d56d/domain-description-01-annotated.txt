The Road Vehicle Register is a public administration information system. It contains records of road vehicles, the owners and operators of these vehicles, lost, stolen, damaged and destroyed road vehicle registration certificates and registration plates.

<vehicle>A vehicle is a machine, usually with wheels, used for transporting people, animals or goods, on land.</vehicle>
<motorised-vehicle>A motorised vehicle is a vehicle with an engine.</motorised-vehicle>
<non-motorised-vehicle>A non-motorised vehicle is a vehicle without an engine.</non-motorised-vehicle>
We distinguish road vehicles and special vehicles.
<road-vehicle>For the purposes of regulating the conditions of operation of vehicles on roads, a road vehicle is a motorised or non-motorised vehicle which is constructed for use on roads for the carriage of persons, animals or goods.</road-vehicle>
<special-vehicle>A special vehicle is a vehicle manufactured for purposes other than road traffic, which may be operated on roads if conditions are met.</special-vehicle>
<vehicle-category>A vehicle category is a group of vehicles which have the same technical conditions laid down in an implementing regulation.
Road vehicles and special vehicles are divided into categories L, M, N, O, T, C, R, S and Z.</vehicle-category>
Motorized road vehicles are divided into the following basic types: <motorcycle>motorcycles</motorcycle>, <passenger-car>passenger cars</passenger-car>, <bus>buses</bus>, <lorry>lorries</lorry>, <special-purpose-vehicle>special purpose vehicles</special-purpose-vehicle>, and <powered-wheelchair>powered wheelchairs if their width or length exceeds 1.4 m, their design speed exceeds 15 km.h-1 or their maximum permissible weight exceeds 450 kg</powered-wheelchair>, and other road vehicles.
Special vehicles are divided into the following basic types: <agricultural-tractor>agricultural or <forestry-tractor>forestry tractors</forestry-tractor></agricultural-tractor> and <forestry-tractor-trailer><agricultural-tractor-trailer>their trailers</agricultural-tractor-trailer></forestry-tractor-trailer>, <self-propelled-work-machine>self-propelled work machines</self-propelled-work-machine>, <work-machine-carried>work machines carried</work-machine-carried>, <work-machine-attached>work machines attached</work-machine-attached>, <interchangeable-towed-equipment>interchangeable towed equipment</interchangeable-towed-equipment>, <snow-vehicle>vehicles designed primarily for driving on snow</snow-vehicle>, <off-road-vehicle>vehicles designed primarily for off-road driving</off-road-vehicle>, <single-axle-tractor>single-axle tractors</single-axle-tractor> and <single-axle-tractor-trailer>their trailers</single-axle-tractor-trailer>, <special-tractor>special tractors</special-tractor> and <special-tractor-trailer>their trailers</special-tractor-trailer>, <carrier-of-working-adaptors>carriers of working adaptors</carrier-of-working-adaptors> and other special vehicles.
<trailer>A trailer is a non-motorised road vehicle intended to be towed by another vehicle to which it is coupled in a combination.</trailer>
<vehicle-system>Vehicle system means any <has-vehicle-system>structural system of a vehicle</has-vehicle-system> which is subject to the technical requirements laid down in an implementing regulation. An example of a vehicle system is brakes or emission reduction devices.</vehicle-system>

<technical-inspection>A road vehicle technical inspection is an inspection of its roadworthiness which includes the technical condition and functioning of a road vehicle, its systems, components and separate technical units and their environmental impact or a registration test of a road vehicle.</technical-inspection>
<technical-inspection-station>A technical inspection station is a workplace specialised in carrying out technical inspections of road vehicles.</technical-inspection-station>
<operated-by>A technical inspection station may be operated by a legal or natural person who has a licence to operate it and a certificate issued by the regional authority.</operated-by> The competent authority to decide on the granting of the authorisation is the regional authority in whose administrative district the operator of the technical inspection station will carry out its activities.

<emission-measurement>Emissions measurement as part of the technical inspection can be carried out at the emission measurement station before other inspection tasks are carried out at the technical inspection station.</emission-measurement> The emission measurement station shall draw up <emission-measurement-report-handed-over-to>a report on the emission measurement which shall be handed over to the natural person who brought the vehicle to the emission measurement station.</emission-measurement-report-handed-over-to>

In such a case, the day on which the other checking operations were carried out in the framework of the periodic technical inspection at the technical inspection station shall be considered as the day on which the periodic technical inspection of the road vehicle was carried out. If more than 30 days have elapsed between <date-of-emission-measurement>the date on which the emission measurement was carried out</date-of-emission-measurement> and <other-operations-date>the date on which the road vehicle was brought in for the other checking operations</other-operations-date>, the emission measurement carried out shall not be taken into account.

<technical-inspection>During a technical inspection, the technical inspection station shall determine whether <has-road-vehicle-defect>the technical condition and operation of the road vehicle, <has-vehicle-system-defect>its systems, <has-structural-component-defect>structural components and <has-technical-unit-defect>separate technical units are free from defects or have defects</has-technical-unit-defect></has-structural-component-defect></has-vehicle-system-defect></has-road-vehicle-defect> by comparing the actual technical condition of the road vehicle with the conditions laid down for the technical condition of the vehicle.</technical-inspection>

<detects>The technical inspection of a road vehicle can detect 3 levels of defects</detects>, which are
- <minor-defect>a minor defect which does not significantly affect the operational characteristics of the vehicle, road safety or the environment,</minor-defect>

- <dangerous-defect>a dangerous defect which poses an immediate threat to the safety of the road vehicle, to road traffic or to the environment.</dangerous-defect>

<technically-fit-road-vehicle>A road vehicle is technically fit for use on the road if no defects or only minor defects have been found during the road vehicle technical inspection. If the technical inspection has revealed minor defects, the operator of the road vehicle shall remedy them.</technically-fit-road-vehicle> <affixed-by>The technical inspection station shall affix <inspection-sticker><affixed-on>an inspection sticker</affixed-by> on the rear plate of the registration plate of the road vehicle</affixed-on> indicating the <next-inspection-month>month and <next-inspection-year>year of the next periodic technical inspection of the road vehicle</next-inspection-year></next-inspection-month></inspection-sticker>.

<limited-technically-fit-vehicle>If a technical inspection detects a serious defect, the vehicle is technically fit for use only for 30 days from the date of the technical inspection. <repeatedly-inspected-for-serious-defects-by>Within this period, the operator of the road vehicle shall be obliged to bring the road vehicle with the rectified serious defect to the technical inspection station for a repeat technical inspection.</repeatedly-inspected-for-serious-defects-by></limited-technically-fit-vehicle> <technically-unfit-road-vehicle>If the operator of the road vehicle does not proceed in this way, or if the repeated technical inspection reveals that the defect to be rectified has been recurrently rectified, the vehicle is technically unfit for use and may not be used in traffic.</technically-unfit-road-vehicle> The operator shall be obliged to ensure that the vehicle is towed away from the technical inspection station at his own expense.

<technically-unfit-road-vehicle>If the technical inspection of a road vehicle reveals a dangerous defect, the vehicle is technically unfit for use and must not be used in traffic.</technically-unfit-road-vehicle> The operator is obliged to ensure that the vehicle is towed at his own expense from the technical inspection station, that the dangerous defect is removed, and that <repeatedly-inspected-for-dangerous-defects-by>the road vehicle is brought in for a repeat technical inspection</repeatedly-inspected-for-dangerous-defects-by>. <removed-by>Upon detection of a dangerous defect, the technical inspection station shall remove the technical inspection sticker from the rear plate of the registration plate.</removed-by>
