In the realm of academic conferences, a conference represents an event where research papers are presented and discussed. This gathering is characterized by a specific year when it takes place, a location where it is held, and a its name.

Focusing on the research papers, these are documents presenting original research findings. Each research paper is linked to a submission, which represents the act of submitting the paper for consideration at a conference. The submission process is crucial as it brings the paper into the conference's review process. A research paper also has several intrinsic qualities. It has a publication year, marking when the findings were officially made public. An abstract provides a brief summary of the paper's content. The paper's presentation at a conference is also an important aspect that we need to know about the paper. Moreover, the title of the paper gives it a distinct identity. An essential aspect of a research paper is its authorship, indicated by the written by attribute, which links it to its authors.

Authors, who significantly contribute to the creation of research papers, have their own distinct characteristics. An author's institutional affiliation provides a professional identity and context. Additionally, one of the authors may be designated as the corresponding author, highlighting their primary responsibility in communication regarding the paper.

The review process is integral to the conference's academic rigor. A review, an evaluation or critique of a research paper by a reviewer, plays a pivotal role. A review reviews the submission it evaluates. Only the last submission of a research paper can be evaluated.

The individuals involved in the conference reviewing process are categorized under the person classification. Each person has a name, giving them individual identity, and an email address, facilitating communication within the academic community.

Within the persons category, a reviewer stands out as a specific role. A reviewer, responsible for evaluating the quality and relevance of research paper submissions, brings to the table their area of expertise. This expertise is essential in ensuring the academic rigor and relevance of the review process. A reviewer is involved in review process by the act of writing reviews.

Lastly, the submission itself is a critical element. Representing the act of submitting a research paper for consideration at a conference, it encompasses various aspects. A submission is linked to the conference it is submitted to and carries a submission date, marking when it entered the review process. The current status of the submission, such as under review, accepted, or rejected, is a dynamic attribute reflecting its ongoing journey. Submissions can be resubmissions, linked to prior submissions they replace, showing the iterative nature of academic work. Furthermore, a submission is reviewed by a reviewer, a connection that is fundamental to the peer-review process and maintaining the academic integrity of the conference proceedings.
