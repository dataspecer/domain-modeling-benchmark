Imagine an online platform where gamers from around the world come to play, compete, and interact. The core of this platform is its ability to host multiple types of games, ranging from strategy games and first-person shooters to puzzle games and sports simulations. Each game is characterized by its title, developer, and a brief description. Games need to be categorized for easy browsing. Each game can be played by individual players. Every player has a unique username, an avatar, an email address, and a password. A player can be a member of various teams. A team has a unique name and a team symbol. For a player we track game statistics for each given game they play. The game statistics of a player include the number of played sessions in that game, highest achieved score, and the best achieved ranking. Players can earn achievements based on their overall gaming performance accross the all played games. Players have other players as friends. Players enroll in tournaments. A tournament has starting and ending dates, and the game played on that tournament. Tournaments might have entry requirements such as minimum player rankings in the played game or entry fees. Players can purchase paid games, in-game items offered inside individual games, or subscribe to premium memberships. Some tournaments can be available only to players who are premium members. Transactions include payment methods and transaction dates. For payments traceability, each transaction made by a player is linked to the paid item, i.e. the tournament for which a fee was paid, the purchased game, the purchased in-game item or paid premium membership. Players can rate games. A rating of a game by a player has the number of stars, from zero to five, and may have a review text. High average rating of a game can influence how it is presented on the platform.
